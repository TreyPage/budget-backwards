##### This is a budgeting application that allows user to input their expenses and income and receive a break down on where their money should go and what percentages their expenses are.
I am going to do a budget app that approaches finances differently. My app will appeal to anyone looking to understand their finances and get their money under control. 
I'm unsure on data or services for my app as I don't think any are absolutely essential, but i have found things like inspirational quotes and google log in that aren't essential but could add to the look and feel of the app. 
The app will need to maintain users expenses and income at all times.
I'm thinking that a navigation drawer is going to be the best for my app. It will allow the user to go back and forth between expenses and income quickly and effeciently.

The main big difference between my budget app and the other 3.8 trillion (random guess) will be that it takes in all projected monthly expenses first, then when income is applied it will tell you how to seperate your income to cover those expenses. Once all expenses are covered it will give "play" money, but not until the essentials are covered. It will also give you percentages on your expenses so you can better compare to things that say your housing should only be X% of your monthly income.
