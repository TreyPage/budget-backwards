#### This is a personal android project
##### This is a budgeting application that allows user to input their expenses and income and receive a break down on where their money should go and what percentages their expenses are.
I am going to do a budget app that approaches finances differently. My app will appeal to anyone looking to understand their finances and get their money under control. 

The main big difference between my budget app and the other 3.8 trillion (random guess) will be that it takes in all projected monthly expenses first, then when income is applied it will tell you how to seperate your income to cover those expenses. Once all expenses are covered it will give "play" money, but not until the essentials are covered. It will also give you percentages on your expenses so you can better compare to things that say your housing should only be X% of your monthly income.
